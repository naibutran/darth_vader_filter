The main point of this project is to doing a simple filter without using too much modern CV library (openCV, Image) or their functions. 

I only used mediapipe for extracting body point to help other tasks. I coded functions like: find distance, angle, conditions for triggering, and even a lot of basic calculations on images. 

Codes and comments are all displayed in *pose.ipynb* file.
